                <h3>Personal Journey</h3>
                <p>I believe it's never too late to chase a new dream - even if it means changing careers at the age of 28. My journey into web development started with a bold step: enrolling in an online bootcamp for full-stack development. But learning a skill this complex takes time, patience, and persistence. I quickly realized that mastering the craft wouldn't happen overnight, and that every step is part of the process.</p>
                <p>Right now, I'm focusing on front-end development, shaping digital experiences one element at a time. Through freeCodeCamp, I started my deep dive into responsive web design using HTML and CSS. Soon, I'll be expanding my expertise into JavaScript and frameworks like Bootstrap. With every lesson, I absorb more of the syllabus, strengthening my skills bit by bit.</p>
                <p>Of course setbacks happen. Frustration, overwhelm, and moments of doubt are part of the journey. But no matter how many times I stumble, I remind myself of my ultimate goal: becoming a full-stack developer. Growth is not linear - it's full of twists and turns, but every challenge refines my skills and strengthens my resilience.</p>
                <p>So I keep moving forward. Setbacks? Frustrations? They're simply part of learning. Through it all, I rely on my greatest strength - my willpower.</p>
